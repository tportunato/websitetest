# DAA Capital Partners — Website Skeleton (Pass 1)

Cinematic one-pager: React + Vite, GSAP ScrollTrigger, Lenis smooth scroll.
Six story beats, three AI-generated draft video backgrounds, two code-driven
canvas animations, placeholder copy in DAA voice.

## Run locally
    npm install
    npm run dev

## Deploy
1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. Import the repo in Vercel. Framework preset: Vite (auto-detected). No config needed.

## Swapping in final videos
Replace the files in `public/videos/` keeping the SAME filenames:
- `beat01-city-vans.mp4` (hero, Paris vans)
- `beat02-warehouse-timelapse.mp4` (market section)
- `beat04-facade-dolly.mp4` (asset management section)

Current files are 720p Veo Fast drafts, re-encoded to ~2MB each (crf 27) with
poster frames for instant paint. When the final 1080p Quality renders arrive,
give them to Claude for the same compression + poster treatment before committing.

Performance architecture: canvas sections pause their animation loops when
off-screen and resume on re-entry; MapLibre maps initialize only when their
section comes within 600px of the viewport; canvas DPR is capped at 1.5.

## Where things live
- Copy: `src/sections/*.jsx` (each section is one story beat)
- Colors/typography: `src/styles.css` (`:root` variables at top)
- Canvas animations (beats 03/05): `src/sections/Edge.jsx`, `src/sections/Portfolio.jsx`

## Beat 03: the Sonar scan — IMPORTANT, two files to copy
`Edge.jsx` is a faithful port of the Sonar app intro: same MapLibre dark basemap,
same palette, same timeline, same drawing code. To make it visually IDENTICAL to
the app, copy TWO files from the sonar repo into this repo:

    sonar/public/data/showcase/lyon.json  ->  daa-website/public/data/showcase/lyon.json
    sonar/public/data/metro/lyon.json     ->  daa-website/public/data/metro/lyon.json

(create the folders). The first carries the real road network; the second the
motorway isochrones. Without them the component falls back to the bundled
salvaged snapshot (`public/data/showcase-lyon.json`: real industrial points and
candidates, but synthesized roads and no isochrones).
The basemap loads MapLibre from jsDelivr and dark tiles from Carto's public CDN.

## Placeholders requiring sign-off (all marked with dashed amber badges on the page)
- "-35% completions (CBRE)" stat — verify source and figure
- "XX% off-market" stat — real number needed
- Track record counters (12%+ target IRR, EUR 300m, 6 markets) — compliance sign-off
- Quote + team photography in the Proof section

## Known limitations of Pass 1 (deliberate)
- Videos play on scroll-enter and hold their last frame (no scroll-scrubbing yet)
- No News section wiring (WordPress API integration is a later pass)
- Mobile uses CSS-cropped 16:9 videos (fine for drafts)
- No cookie banner / GDPR wiring yet
- Wordmark is styled text; drop in the real DAA logo SVG when ready


## Pages (added in pass 3)
Hash-routed pages, no server config needed:
- `#/portfolio` — interactive asset map (MapLibre), data in `src/data/assets.js`
- `#/leadership` — team page, data in `src/data/team.js`

Asset and team photos are hotlinked from the existing daacap.com WordPress.
To use better photos: drop files into `public/images/` and update the `img`
fields in the two data files. Keep the old WordPress running as long as the
new site hotlinks its media.
